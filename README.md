# Holes and Vents

## Overview
**Holes and Vents** is a fun and engaging board game, inspired by the classic "Snakes and Ladders" game, but with a twist! In this version, players are transported randomly to other vents on the board, which could either help or hinder their progress. Instead of snakes and ladders, the game features **vents** that move players to different parts of the board, potentially advancing them or sending them backward.

This game is built using Python and the Pygame library, and offers an interactive and visually appealing game experience.

## Features
- **Custom Vents**: Random vents on the board that transport players to different vent locations when landed on.
- **Dice Roll**: Players take turns rolling a dice, which determines how far they can move forward.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Compete with another player as you both race towards the goal at square 100.
- **Randomized Vents**: The vents are randomly placed on the board, creating a dynamic experience every time the game is played.
- **Colorful Board**: The game features a colorful and vibrant grid where players move their pieces and experience the game.
